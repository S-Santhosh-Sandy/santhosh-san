MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE USED HERE IS : Elastic Net (Which is an Regression Model deals with exact or appropriate values)

ELASTIC NET:
Elastic net regression is a linear regression technique that uses a penalty term to shrink the coefficients of the predictors. 
The penalty term is a combination of the l1-norm (absolute value) and the l2-norm (square) of the coefficients, weighted by a parameter called alpha.

The efficiency of the ML model is about 99.99999 % (approx) which is R square
The MSE is 21.093
